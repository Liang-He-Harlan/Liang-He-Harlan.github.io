Ph.D. candidate, [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/)

Iâ€™m currently a Ph.D. student at McGill University. I feel fortunate to have the opportunity to be co-supervised by both Prof. [Alan C Evans](https://www.mcgill.ca/neuro/alan-c-evans-phd) and Prof. [Xue Liu](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~xueliu/site/intro.html). I sincerely appreciate Prof. [Alan C Evans](https://www.mcgill.ca/neuro/alan-c-evans-phd) and Prof. [Xi Jiang](https://faculty.uestc.edu.cn/jiangxi/en/index.htm). Their careful guidance helped me take the first step from curriculum to scientific research, enabling me to obtain the master's degree.
